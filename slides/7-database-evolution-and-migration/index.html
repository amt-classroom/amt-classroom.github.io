                        An **Abstraction** is a simplified view of an entity that omits unimportant details to enable higher level thinking.

                        **Key principle:** The word "**unimportant**" is crucial
                        - Omitting unimportant details → simpler, easier to understand
                        - Omitting important details → false abstraction, obscurity

                        **Two ways abstractions fail:**
                        1. **Including unimportant details** → unnecessary complexity
                        2. **Omitting important details** → obscurity, incorrect usage

                        **Example: File System**
                        - ✅ Omits: block allocation mechanism (unimportant to users)
                        - ❌ Cannot omit: data flushing rules (critical for databases)

                        Notes:

                        In modular programming, each module provides an abstraction through its interface. The interface presents a simplified view - implementation details are omitted because they're unimportant from the abstraction's standpoint.

                        The file system example shows how some details (like block allocation) can be hidden, while others (like when data is written to disk) must be exposed because they're critical for certain use cases like databases that need to guarantee data persistence.

                        We use abstractions everywhere: microwaves hide complex electronics behind simple buttons, cars hide intricate mechanisms behind a steering wheel and pedals.

                        **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** provides an abstraction over database operations.

                        **What ORMs abstract away (unimportant details):**
                        - SQL query syntax and dialect differences
                        - Connection management and pooling
                        - Basic CRUD operations boilerplate
                        - Type conversions between database and application

                        **What ORMs cannot hide (important details):**
                        - Database schema design and relationships
                        - Query performance and optimization (N+1 problem)
                        - Transaction boundaries and isolation levels
                        - Data consistency and integrity constraints

                        **Trade-off:** Productivity vs. Control

                        Notes:

                        ORMs like Hibernate, JPA, Entity Framework, or ActiveRecord aim to simplify database interactions by mapping objects to tables. They handle repetitive tasks and provide database independence.

                        However, they cannot abstract away fundamental database concepts. Developers still need to understand how databases work, especially for:
                        - Performance-critical queries
                        - Complex joins and aggregations
                        - Concurrency and locking
                        - Schema evolution

                        This is a classic example of leaky abstraction - the abstraction works well for simple cases but requires understanding the underlying system for complex scenarios.

                        **Schema generation abstracts database design, but it's a leaky abstraction** - it works for simple cases but requires understanding the underlying database for production use.

                        Hibernate exposes the following mode for generating the database schema.

                        | validate          | validate the database schema without changing it     | <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check"></i> |
                        | update             | only export what's missing in the schema           | <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i> |

                        The [Hibernate User Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#best-practices) discourage using `update` in production proving the limits of this abstraction.

                        The [Hibernate User Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#schema-generation) documentation also states that while automatic schema generation is very useful for testing and prototyping, in a production environment, it’s much more flexible to manage the schema using incremental migration scripts, as these provide safety, auditability, and control over changes.

                        The abstraction omits important details leading to an incorrect usage of the database:
                        * The associative table is unexpected for a one-to-many relation and likely to lead to performance issues.
                        * The naming of foreign key constraints are technical and debatable.

                        The solution is to use [more annotations and code](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/) to obtain a saner database schema; however, requiring additional annotations and code to correct the schema exposes underlying database details, reducing the effectiveness of the abstraction.

                        * abstract away the database until it doesn't (e.g. performance issues, errors, data loss).
                        * has to take decisions that might be unexpected, perform poorly or hard to comprehend from a RDBMS perspective
                        * the schema is not under control as it is applied dynamically at runtime.
                        * the breakaway effort is correlated to the growth of the schema while it was not under control

                        Notes:

                        The [Hibernate User Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#best-practices) recommends to put migrations under control:
                        
                        Although Hibernate provides the update option for the hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto configuration property, this feature is not suitable for a production environment.
                        </br>[...]</br>
                        An automated schema migration tool (e.g. Flyway, Liquibase) allows you to use any database-specific DDL feature (e.g. Rules, Triggers, Partitioned Tables). Every migration should have an associated script, which is stored on the Version Control System, along with the application source code.
                        </br>[...]</br>
                        You should always use an automatic schema migration tool and have all the migration scripts stored in the Version Control System.

                        ORMs are complex abstractions and leak by design. They are often highly criticized because of misplaced expectations.
                        Using an ORM abstraction doesn't remove the need to understand the database.

                        Notes:

                        If you are writing an application backed by a relational database you should damn well know how a relational database works.
                        </br>[...]</br>
                        they just want to deal with in-memory data-structures and let the ORM deal with the database. This way of thinking can work for small applications and loads, but it soon falls apart once the going gets tough
                        </br>[...]</br>
                        Active Record [a Ruby On Rails ORM] is designed with that in mind, it takes care of boring stuff, but provides manholes so you can get down with the SQL when you have to.

                        Abstractions that generate code and schemas are often mistrusted, however they are ubiquitous to software development.
                        They come with various qualities and weaknesses.

                        The decision making for abstraction choices is different according to each project's context. For example:
                        * lifetime of the application (i.e.  a few months, several years)
                        * existing and predominant skills of the contributors
                        * domain complexity
                        * abstraction relevance in meetings the expressed needs


                        When depending on a abstraction that generates code or schemas becomes crucial:
                        * place them under control
                        * track the changes
                        * learn and understand what and how it abstracts

                        When **developing** an application, the database schema will evolve over time.
                        - **Without production data**, it is easy to **drop and recreate** the database from scratch.

                        Once the application is in **production**, the database schema will continue to evolve.
                        - **With production data**, evolution requires **migrations**.

                        **Migration tools** address this problem by allowing you to evolve the database schema while keeping the data.

                        This figure illustrates a deployment and migration process orchestrated by a CI/CD pipeline.

                        The CI/CD pipeline will:
                        - Run the database migration scripts
                        - Progressively deploy the new version of the application

                        This process allows you to deploy a new version of the application without downtime.
                        However, some inconsistencies may occur during the deployment.
                        
                        **Can you spot them?**

                        Answer:
                        - Errors/downtime might arise from app v1 using schema v2 due to backward incompatible change
                        - migrations can own locks that block app queries

                        Flyway is a database migration tool that is very easy to use.

                        You can add Flyway to your Quarkus project by adding the following dependency:

                        ```
                        <dependency>
                            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
                            <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
                        </dependency>

                        ```

                        Then, you can add your migration scripts in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` folder.

                        ```
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_person_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__create_order_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__create_order_line_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V4__create_item_table.sql
                        ```

                        Flyway will automatically execute these scripts in the correct order and track which scripts have already been executed.

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> Be careful with migrations

                        When using migration tools, you should be **extremely careful**:
                        - **Backup your database** before running a migration script
                        - **Test your migration** scripts on a dump of your production database before running them in production
                        - **Never modify** a migration script that has already been executed
                        - **Never delete** or rename executed migration scripts

                        If you break these rules, you will **break the migration process**.
                       
                        **Forward thinking** is key when writing migration scripts.

                        Notes:

                        Migration tools like Flyway abstract away the complexity of tracking which migrations have been executed. However, this is a leaky abstraction - you still need to understand what's happening underneath:
                        - Flyway maintains a schema history table to track executed migrations
                        - Checksums are used to detect if a migration file has been modified
                        - Once executed, migrations become part of your database's history
                        
                        Breaking these rules exposes the abstraction's limitations and can lead to inconsistent states across environments.

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> What about rollbacks?

                        **Rollbacks abstract the complexity of undoing changes, but this abstraction has important limitations.**

                        The undo feature of Flyway is part of the commercial version. Even with open-source alternatives (e.g. [Liquibase](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html)), the **rollback feature is not a silver bullet**. 
                        
                        **Why rollbacks are a leaky abstraction:**
                        - **Destructive changes are non-trivial to reverse** - After dropping a table or column, data is lost and cannot be recovered
                        - **Expressing the inverse requires manual work** - You often need to manually create the "undo" migration script
                        - **Some operations have no inverse** - How do you "undelete" dropped data?

                        **Forward thinking** is crucial. For example:
                        - Mark data as deprecated first, delete in a later migration
                        - Add new columns before removing old ones (expand and contract pattern)

                        > Rolling forward acknowledges that the later state (v4) occurred, and migrates ahead to a new distinct version (v5) that just happens to correspond to a previous state (v3).

                        Notes:

                        This is another example where the abstraction (automatic rollbacks) omits important details. The tool cannot know:
                        - Whether data loss is acceptable
                        - How to reconstruct deleted data
                        - Complex business logic embedded in the migration

                        **Some migrations require procedural logic that SQL alone cannot express.**

                        Most RDBMSs support a procedural language with variables, control-flow, and error handling.

                        **Examples:**
                        - PostgreSQL: **PL/pgSQL**
                        - MySQL: **SQL/PSM** (Persistent Stored Modules)
                        - Oracle: **PL/SQL** (original)

                        Standard SQL abstracts data manipulation but omits procedural capabilities. PL/SQL and its variants expose these important details when migrations need:
                        - Conditional logic during data transformation
                        - Iterative processing of records
                        - Complex business rules during migration

                        Backward compatible changes are trivial to introduce as they can be introduced decoupled of changes within the code base. 
                        Backward-incompatible changes are non-trivial to apply as it will require to synchronize with changes to the code base and their respective deployments.

                        **Backward-incompatible, Downtime**

                        When service downtime is acceptable, you can implement a breaking change by coordinating changes to both the application and database schema in a single deployment. The process is as follows:

                        - Shut down all instances of application version X, so no instances are reading from or writing to database schema version Y.
                        - Deploy application version X+1 which runs migration scripts to update the database to schema version Y+1, which is compatible with the new application version.
                        - Application version X+1 and database schema version Y+1 are now up and running together.

                        Notes:

                        While this approach requires downtime, it also requires careful planning to ensure that the new application and database versions are compatible and can be deployed together. This method becomes complex and error-prone when multiple applications use the same database, and deployment automation must handle this coordinated process. This method may work for prototype applications but isn’t reliable for production.

                        **Backward-incompatible, expand and contract**

                        Expand and contract is a pattern to break backward-incompatible changes into a chain of backward-compatible changes through three distinctive phases. The changes in code and database schema are decoupled so that they can be developed, tested and deployed separately.
                        * **Expand**, introduce backward-compatible changes that implement the refactoring in the database schema.
                        * **Migrate**, introduce code changes that are moving to the new capabilities of the refactored database schema.
                        * **Contract** (i.e. to reduce to smaller size), consolidation by removing or cleaning-up any non-essential changes introduced in the expand phase to support the migration phase that are not used by the code anymore.

                        Notes:
                        This pattern is not limited to database refactoring and can be applied in [others contexts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ParallelChange.html).
