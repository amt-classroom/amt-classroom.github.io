                        Schema generation is a useful tool in early phases, but at some point a breakaway will likely be required.

                        The schema generation:
                        * abstract away the database until it doesn't (e.g. performance issues, errors, data loss).
                        * has to take decisions that might be unexpected, perform poorly or hard to comprehend from a RDBMS perspective
                        * the schema is not under control as it is applied dynamically at runtime.
                        * the breakaway effort is correlated to the growth of the schema while it was not under control

                        Hibernate User Guide recommends to put migrations under control:
                        > Although Hibernate provides the update option for the hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto configuration property, this feature is not suitable for a production environment.
                        > </br>[...]</br>
                        > An automated schema migration tool (e.g. Flyway, Liquibase) allows you to use any database-specific DDL feature (e.g. Rules, Triggers, Partitioned Tables). Every migration should have an associated script, which is stored on the Version Control System, along with the application source code.
                        > </br>[...]</br>
                        > You should always use an automatic schema migration tool and have all the migration scripts stored in the Version Control System.

                        The decision making for abstraction choices is different according to each project's context. For example:
                        * lifetime of the application (i.e.  a few months, several years)
                        * existing and predominant skills of the contributors
                        * domain complexity
                        * abstraction relevance in meetings the expressed needs


                        When depending on a abstraction that generates code or schemas becomes crucial:
                        * place them under control
                        * track the changes
                        * learn and understand what and how it abstracts

                        When **developing** an application, the database schema will evolve over time.
                        - **Without production data**, it is easy to **drop and recreate** the database from scratch.

                        Once the application is in **production**, the database schema will continue to evolve.
                        - **With production data**, evolution requires **migrations**.

                        **Migration tools** address this problem by allowing you to evolve the database schema while keeping the data.

                        This figure illustrates a deployment and migration process orchestrated by a CI/CD pipeline.

                        The CI/CD pipeline will:
                        - Run the database migration scripts
                        - Progressively deploy the new version of the application

                        This process allows you to deploy a new version of the application without downtime.
                        However, some inconsistencies may occur during the deployment.
                        
                        **Can you spot them?**

                        Answer:
                        - Errors/downtime might arise from app v1 using schema v2 due to backward incompatible change
                        - migrations can own locks that block app queries

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> Flyway

                        Flyway is a database migration tool that is very easy to use.

                        You can add Flyway to your Quarkus project by adding the following dependency:

                        ```
                        <dependency>
                            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
                            <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
                        </dependency>

                        ```

                        Then, you can add your migration scripts in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` folder.

                        ```
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_person_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__create_order_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__create_order_line_table.sql
                        src/main/resources/db/migration/V4__create_item_table.sql
                        ```

                        Flyway will automatically execute these scripts in the correct order and track which scripts have already been executed.

                        When using migration tools, you should be **extremely careful**:
                        - **Backup your database** before running a migration script.
                        - **Test your migration** scripts on a dump of your production database before running them on the production database.
                        - **Do not** **modify**, **delete**, **rename**, or **change** a migration script that has already been executed.

                        If you do any of these things, you will probably **break the migration process**.
                       
                        **Forward thinking** is key when writing migration scripts.

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> What about rollbacks?
                        The undo feature of Flyway is part of the commercial version. However, even if opensource alternatives exists (e.g. [Liquibase](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html)) the **rollback feature is not a silver bullet**. 
                        
                        - Destructive changes are non-trivial to inverse. For instance, after dropping a table or a column, the data is lost and cannot be recovered.
                        - Expressing the inverse of a migration will often require you to manually create the "undo" migration script.
                        
                        Again, **forward thinking** is crucial when writing migration scripts. For instance, if a migration script deletes data, it is a good idea to first mark the data as deprecated, and then delete it in a later migration script.

                        Another example of forward thinking from the Flyway docs:
                        > Rolling forward acknowledges that the later state (v4) occurred, and migrates ahead to a new distinct version (v5) that just happens to correspond to a previous state (v3).

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> PL/SQL SQL Procedure Language 
                        Some migrations require logic that goes beyond standard SQL statements. Most RDBMSs support a procedural language that enables the use of variables, control-flow, and error handling to implement complex procedures. For example PostgreSQL has PL/pgSQL and MySQL has a syntax close to PL/SQL. 
                        If originally PL/SQL is tied to Oracle, then the [SQL/PSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL/PSM) specification was derived from it. However the term PL/SQL remains and is often used to refer to a procedural feature of most RDBMS, even though that feature isn't exactly the PL/SQL language as found in Oracle products.

                        Here is an example of PL/pgSQL migration function:
                        ```pl/pgsql
                        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION migrate_employees(min_salary INT)
                        RETURNS VOID AS $$
                        DECLARE
                            emp_record RECORD;  -- Variable to hold employee data
                        BEGIN
                            -- Loop through all employees from old_employees
                            FOR emp_record IN
                                SELECT id, name, salary FROM old_employees
                            LOOP
                                -- Check if salary is below the given minimum salary and apply a raise
                                IF emp_record.salary < min_salary THEN
                                    -- Migrate with a 10% raise
                                    INSERT INTO new_employees (id, name, salary)
                                    VALUES (emp_record.id, emp_record.name, emp_record.salary * 1.10);
                                ELSE
                                    -- Migrate without changes
                                    INSERT INTO new_employees (id, name, salary)
                                    VALUES (emp_record.id, emp_record.name, emp_record.salary);
                                END IF;
                            END LOOP;

                            RAISE NOTICE 'Employee data migration completed.';
                        END;
                        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

                        Introducing changes to schemas can be split into two main categories:
                        * Backward compatible changes with the code base
                        * Backward-incompatible changes with the code base

                        Backward compatible changes are trivial to introduce as they can be introduced decoupled of changes within the code base. 
                        Backward-incompatible changes are non-trivial to apply as it will require to synchronize with changes to the code base and their respective deployments.

                        ## <i class="fas fa-database"></i> Database refactoring - Backward-incompatible, Downtime 

                        When service downtime is acceptable, you can implement a breaking change by coordinating changes to both the application and database schema in a single deployment. The process is as follows:

                        - Shut down all instances of application version X, so no instances are reading from or writing to database schema version Y.
                        - Deploy application version X+1 which runs migration scripts to update the database to schema version Y+1, which is compatible with the new application version.
                        - Application version X+1 and database schema version Y+1 are now up and running together.

                        While this approach requires downtime, it also requires careful planning to ensure that the new application and database versions are compatible and can be deployed together. This method becomes complex and error-prone when multiple applications use the same database, and deployment automation must handle this coordinated process. This method may work for prototype applications but isn’t reliable for production.

                        Expand and contract is a pattern to break backward-incompatible changes into a chain of backward-compatible changes through three distinctive phases. The changes in code and database schema are decoupled so that they can be developed, tested and deployed separately.
                        * **Expand**, introduce backward-compatible changes that implement the refactoring in the database schema.
                        * **Migrate**, introduce code changes that are moving to the new capabilities of the refactored database schema.
                        * **Contract** (i.e. to reduce to smaller size), consolidation by removing or cleaning-up any non-essential changes introduced in the expand phase to support the migration phase that are not used by the code anymore.
